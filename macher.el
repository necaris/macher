;;; macher.el --- LLM implementation toolset -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: Kevin Montag
;; Version: 0.3.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.1") (gptel "0.9.8.5"))
;; Keywords: convenience, gptel, llm
;; URL: https://github.com/kmontag/macher

;;; Commentary:
;; macher provides a toolset for project-aware LLM file editing based on gptel.
;;
;; Key features:
;; - Use gptel presets to add context and read/edit tools for the current project
;; - View proposed changes as diff-mode-friendly patches
;; - Send implementation requests using `macher-implement'
;; - Request revisions to patches with `macher-revise'
;;
;; Conceptually, when making a request, macher provides the LLM with a "workspace" containing files
;; from the current project (or just the current file if not in a project), and tools to read/edit
;; files in the workspace. Edits are not persisted to disk, but rather stored in the request's
;; associated `macher-context' object, where they can later be used to generate patches.
;;
;; The main interactive entrypoints are `macher-implement', `macher-revise', and (read-only)
;; `macher-discuss', all of which are wrappers around the more general `macher-action'. Actions run
;; in a dedicated per-workspace request buffer.
;;
;; Under the hood, actions use (ephemeral) gptel presets to set up the request context/tools, and to
;; display changes in a diff buffer when the request is complete. You can also install these presets
;; globally using `macher-install', and then use them in any gptel workflow - for example, you could
;; send a gptel request like:
;;
;;   @macher set up eslint with sensible defaults

;;; Code:

(require 'gptel)
(require 'gptel-context)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'macher-externals)

;;; Preliminary definitions needed for defcustom defaults

(defun macher-action-from-region-or-input (input-prompt transform preset &optional input)
  "Get a macher action plist from user input or the selected region.

First, gets user input from the selected region, or if no region is
selected, prompts interactively using `read-string' with the
INPUT-PROMPT (e.g. \"Your request: \"). If an INPUT argument is provided
explicitly, this step will be skipped and the argument value will be
used directly.

Then, generates a full prompt by calling the TRANSFORM function with two
arguments:

- INPUT - the user input string from the previous step

- IS-SELECTED - a boolean indicating whether the user input was pulled
  from the selected region (as opposed to from a prompt or an explicit
  INPUT argument).

The returned plist will contain the transformed :prompt, the
:preset (simply the PRESET argument), and a :summary (equal to the input
that was passed to the transformer).

This function is used by the default actions in the
'macher-actions-alist', and provided as a convenience for defining
custom actions with the same workflow."

  "Alist of actions that can be invoked within a macher workspace.

These definitions are used by `macher-action' to send macher requests
with a specific workflow, where a prompt is generated based on
contextual information and sent from a shared buffer for the current
workspace. See `macher-action' for a more detailed description of the
workflow.

Each entry is of the form (ACTION . FUNCTION-OR-PLIST) where ACTION is a
symbol representing the action name and FUNCTION-OR-PLIST is (or
returns) a plist containing the following keys:

- :prompt - the full prompt string to send to the LLM.

- :preset - gptel preset to use for the request (optional, defaults to
  'macher). This can be a symbol (one of the keys from
  `macher--presets-alist') or a raw gptel preset plist.

- :summary - a summarized version of the prompt (optional). This won't
  affect the actual request content, but it will be included with the
  'macher-action-execution' struct provided to the before-/after-action
  hooks, for potential usage in the UI. For the built-in actions, this
  will be the raw user input or selected-region text that was used to
  generate the prompt (as opposed to the full prompt including
  instructions and other contextual information). The default action
  buffer UI uses this to render a heading above the full prompt text.

If FUNCTION-OR-PLIST is a function, it will be called in the context
where the action was initiated, so it can access buffer content,
region-selection status, etc. The function must be callable with no
arguments, although additional (i.e. &rest) arguments passed to
`macher-action' will be forwarded to it if provided - this allows, for
example, input strings to be passed programmatically to actions based on
`macher-action-from-region-or-input'."

- The path contains an existing file as a non-final component below the

Absolute paths are allowed, though the rules above apply to the

Once presets are registered, you can use macher functionality in any

  @macher Add an eslint config to this project.

This function registers three presets:

- @macher: Send contextual information about the workspace + tools to

  patch buffer.

- @macher-ro: Send contextual information about the workspace + tools to
  read files.

- @macher-notools: Send contextual information about the workspace, but

NAMES is an optional alist of name overrides, whose entries are
like (PRESET . NAME). PRESET is the preset's standard name symbol (e.g.
\\='macher-notools) and NAME is the symbol to actually register with
gptel. You can also pass a nil NAME to disable registering a preset

(defun macher-action (action &optional callback &rest action-args)
  "Send the prompt for a macher ACTION within a shared workspace buffer.

More specifically, this function implements the following workflow for
sending macher requests:

1. Generate a prompt based on contextual information, e.g. the cursor
   position or selected region.

2. Send the prompt from a shared workspace buffer (the
   `macher-action-buffer'), using a gptel preset that provides macher
   tools.

Lifecycle hooks are also run to allow modifying or otherwise handling
the prompt/response - see 'macher-action-dispatch-hook',
'macher-before-action-functions', and 'macher-after-action-functions'.
The default action buffer UI uses these hooks to render information
about outgoing action requests.

ACTION can be a symbol defined in 'macher-actions-alist', or a list with
the same format as an entry in 'macher-actions-alist' (e.g.
'(my-action-name . my-action-function-or-plist)).

If CALLBACK is provided, it will be called when the action completes.
The callback will receive three arguments, the same as functions in
'macher-after-action-functions': ERROR (nil on success, or an error
description on failure), EXECUTION (the 'macher-action-execution' object
for the action), and FSM (the `gptel-fsm' object for the request).

Any additional ACTION-ARGS will be forwarded to the action function, or
simply ignored if the action is defined as a plain plist.

When called interactively, prompts the user to select an ACTION from
those available in the 'macher-actions-alist'.

Note that macher presets can be used with any gptel request, and you
don't need to use this function to use macher. This function simply
implements one possible workflow."
